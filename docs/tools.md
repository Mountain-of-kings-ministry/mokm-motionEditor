# MOKM Effector — Timeline Tool Architecture

Transision tool
this tool is for making transition effects

This structure keeps your editor:

* scalable
* organized
* professional
* modular

You should implement tools by CATEGORY, not randomly.

This is how:

* DaVinci Resolve
* Blender
* Adobe After Effects
* Final Cut Pro

organize their editing systems.
